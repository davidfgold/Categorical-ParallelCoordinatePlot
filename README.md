## Grouped Parallel Axis Plotting tool
This code was not written by the Reed group, but only slightly modified from the parallel coordinate tool for visualizing Nutritional Data from the D3 library: http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/0d1635533f6fb5ac4da3

This repository is only temporary, for purposes of hosting the tool on Github Pages, for long term use we are going to Fork the original instead of using this one.

The input for this tool is a .csv file with columns corresponding to each objective and rows corresponding to each solution. All columns should have headers and the file should containt a column named "group" that has a category for each solution.
